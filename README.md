<h1> GSM-BASED-SMART-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM  - KISHAN MITRA </h1>

**Challenge Description in Smart Gujarat For New India Hackathon 2019-20**

<p align="justify">Irrigation system is critical in the development of agriculture of every country. It has been established that efficient irrigation processes have the potential of literally doubling the
amount of food a farm processes.Integrating modern technologies in irrigation management systems is one of the ways of enhancing the irrigation processes to optimize the use of water and 
electric power consumption.The system however, depends on the timely application of the water pump operates via SMS. </p>

**What Exact Problem is being Solved?**

<p align="justify">As we all know that India is an agriculture oriented country, now a day’s our farmers are facing very difficulties in irrigating the land due to the lack of power supply or unable to get
the required supply on-time. Required power supply to run the irrigation motor (3Phase) will get usually in night in villages, very hardly they get power in day time. So to turn on the
motor someone has to go to the field and turn on. Keeping this in mind we came up with the concept called Remote Water Pump Controller for Agriculture Using GSM. This can be used to 
turn ON and OFF the Motor Remotely.</p>

**Users**

<p align="justify">There are so many applications for the proposed problem statement. Like say the farmers where they have a limited time of electricity, large scale organization. The system supports
water management decision, which determines the controlling time for the process and monitoring the whole system through GSM module Expected Outcomes After Developing this project, 
the user should not require to reach the location where the pump is installed. Individuals can also use this product to operate the water pump remotely. 
This system avoids over irrigation, under irrigation, top soil erosion and reduce the wastage of water.</p>

<p align="justify">The main advantage is that the system’s action can be changed according to the situation (crops, weather conditions, soil etc.). By implementing this system, agricultural,horticultural lands, 
parks, gardens, golf courses can be irrigated. Thus, this system is cheaper and efficient when compared to other type of automation system.In large scale applications,high sensitivity sensors 
can be implemented for large areas of agricultural lands. A stand by battery or solar cells can be implemented which comes into use in case of power cuts. A
secondary pump can be used in case of failure of the pump.</p>

**Potential Impact**
<p align="justify">Irrigation techniques in India are through the manual control in which the farmers irrigate the land at regular intervals. Manual operation of the routine practices in agriculture requires lot of attention and care. 
Also it is difficult to perform desired jobs efficiently and precisely. Ultimately this may result in lower crop production, non-uniform growth and poor quality. 
The  introduction of automation in irrigation system will result in increased application efficiency and drastically reduce labor requirement.The proposed system helps to monitor and control the irrigation system using a simple mobile phone. 
The automation includes distant control of motor operation using GSM.</p>
